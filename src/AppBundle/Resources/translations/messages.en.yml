        headline: How billing works
        introduction_one: When running your remote desktop, ubiqMachine charges you for usage hours.
                          A new usage hour begins as soon as your remote desktop finished booting and
                          is therefore available for use. Within this running usage hour, you can stop
                          and start your remote desktop as ofent as you wish, without any effect on
                          billing.
        introduction_two: In case your remote desktop is still running at the end of the
                          usage hour, another usage hour begins, and you are charged for it.
        introduction_three: The diagrams below visualize this mechanism.
